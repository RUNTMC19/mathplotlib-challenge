MatPlotLib Challenge Observations

1. The Infubinol regimen had the second greatest interquartile range, but more notably, the only regimen that had an outlier below the lower quartile.

2. It is inferred that the Capomulin regimen had the best effect due to the data showing it produced the lowest interquartile range in terms of tumor volume.

3. There is a trend where the larger the weight of a mouse is, the more likely they are to produce higher average tumor volumes.
